                            <p>Short Answer: No</p>
                            <p>Long Answer: Archiverse represents everything Archive Team grabbed during the Miiverse shutdown. While we attempted to download and store as much as possible, given the amount of time to do the archive and the crawling we had to do to get what we ended up with, there is no way to know precisely how much we missed. From Miiverse administrators deleting users and posts, users who hid their profiles, new communities created after the shutdown notice went out, to stability issues with Miiverse itself, many things would stop a complete archive of the site. </p>
                            <p>Of course, Nintendo themselves did have the complete databases and assets available. If they still do, they could donate them to make this genuinely complete. As it stands, this is the best we could do.</p>

                            <p>Archiverse is a contraction of "Archive" and "Miiverse." There will be no "new" content posted here. If someone wanted to use the raw data from this archive and turn it into a new Miiverse revival, you might be able to. But, honestly, you would be better off starting fresh.</p>
                            <p>And if you do decide to start one, please, come up with a plan of what to do when your site shuts down. 😉</p>

                            <p>There are many reasons (and excuses) for why whatever it is you're looking for is not available. </p>
                            <p>For user accounts, if it was hidden or deleted, there was no way to capture their profile page. In some cases, I could correlate data taken from game community feeds to recreate what their feed and profile may have been. </p>
                            <p>Nintendo created some communities tied to specific events, such as E3. After those events ended, those communities would be hidden, but posts users made were still available on their feeds. I've organized those posts to represent these communities, but we don't have the original pages available.</p>
                            <p>The crawler we created to archive each Miiverse page supported paging through each user and games post feeds. However, this doesn't mean it was perfect. It could only capture what the site itself surfaced so that a post could have been missed during the crawl.</p>
                            <p>What we have captured was the best we could do, given the constraints given.</p>
